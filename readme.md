# FacebookWitAiExploration
In June 2016 I looked into using Facebook Messenger with [Wit.ai](http://wit.ai) to take the user through the process of buying train tickets. I did this to get a better understanding of the craze that was exploding.

There are now more online NLP chatbot options out there - some that don't require a backend at all if you are just returning text! - so this code is out of date. 

I have subsequently picked up Django in my own time so if I was to create another chatbot it would like very different to this.
